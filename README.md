<h1>Use Wireshark To Analyze Network Packets </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I learned the basics of Wireshark and how to analyse protocols and PCAPs. Wireshark is an open-source, cross-platform network packet analyzer tool capable of sniffing and investigating live traffic and inspecting packet captures (PCAP). It is commonly used as one of the best packet analysis tools. In this room, we will look at the basics of Wireshark and use it to perform fundamental packet analysis.
